# So Here it really is - you are actually lucky that I would post this as it is
# not right that I had to do all the hard work...so I have completely messed it all up
# Only messing, but you will have to do a little work if you want to use this code
# Just read it and use your eyes to spot what's not right. 

# Clue to solve the major malfunction in this code 

# hoo = a

# Just read the code and you will see what it means

# Other than that this code will knock this mission into next week
